# Robotic-Arm
A custom built functional robotic arm that can pick up and move small, lightweight objects.

# About
This is one of my personal favorite projects due to the combined hardware and software needed to make the arm work. This project used 5 mini servo
motors, an Arduino Uno, and many wires. I personally designed and printed all of the other parts using FreeCAD and my Ender 3D printer.  This project was written
in C and developed in the Arduino IDE.
